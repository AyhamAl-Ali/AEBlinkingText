Quick modifications by: Ayham Al-Ali
Original Author: MotionHub

Notes:
You need to add 3 SliderControle effects to your layer and 1 checkboxControl
Name them Speed, BlinkingSpeed, StartAt, CursorKeepsBlinking (checkbox)
StartAt = time before the text begins to type (cursor will be blinking while that time)
BlinkingSpeed = Cursor blinking speed
Speed = text typing speed (makes it longer or shorter in time)
 
```
